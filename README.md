### Designed for A4T
Crossbow was designed and developed around A4T, but is intended for universal for use in printed toolheads that have a flat mounting surface below the extruder.<br/><br/>
Crossbow A4T parts can be downloaded here: <a href="https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/A4T">https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/A4T</a>.

#### Blade replacement
There is a jig available to help with cutting down a #17 or #4 hobby knife blade: [Blade cutting and alignment jig.stl](<STL/Blade cutting and alignment jig.stl>)

<br/><br/>

> [!TIP] 
> The design accomodates extruders that use the Sherpa-Mini or Oribiter v2.0 mounting hole spacing (Checked for fit with Dragon Burner in CAD models with an example Dragon Burner Mod included in the [Dragon Burner example](<Dragon Burner example>) folder).<br/><br/><img src='docs/images/dragon-burner-example.png' width=200 />

### License clarification regarding non-commercial use:
The non-commercial aspect of this license is for cases where Crossbow is the product, not the use of Crossbow to create products.<br/>
I.e. If you wish to sell Crossbow as a product, you would need to seek a commercial license before doing so. </br>
It is NOT intended to prevent the use of Crossbow in a printer that you use to provide commercial services. If you want to run Crossbow as a toolhead for your print farm printers, go right ahead.
