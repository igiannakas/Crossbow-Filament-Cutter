## Design philosophy
The crossbow filament cutter was developed to provide a robust, reliable, easily serviceable, versatile and universal filament cutting solution for printed toolheads. Key features include:
1. Aluminum CNC construction: Reliable cutting action that can withstand multi-thousand operations without wear.
2. Low profile and low mass: maintains toolhead rigidity, centre of mass and input shaper performance.
3. Ease of servicing: two easily accessible screws to remove and replace cutting blade and clean the filament path.

## Designed for the A4T, but intended for universal use
Crossbow was designed and developed around the A4T, but is intended for universal for use in printed toolheads that have a flat mounting surface below the extruder.<br/><br/>
Crossbow A4T parts can be downloaded here: <a href="https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/A4T">https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/A4T</a>.
<br/><br/>

> [!TIP] 
> The design accomodates extruders that use the Sherpa-Mini or Oribiter v2.0 mounting hole spacing (Checked for fit with Dragon Burner in CAD models with an example Dragon Burner Mod included in the [Dragon Burner example](<Dragon Burner example>) folder).<br/><br/><img src='docs/images/dragon-burner-example.png' width=200 />

## Blade replacement
Blade replacement is generally recomended after 3000-4000 cuts, depending on the material being cut. Crossbow can use a #17 or #4 hobby knife blade. Trimming the blades to size is required. The following jig is available to help cut the blade down.

**Jig BOM:**
1. 4x M3x8 SHCS / BHCS screws
2. 4x M3 Square Nuts (DIN 562)
3. #17 or #4 hobby knife blade
4. Printed jig parts: [Blade cutting and alignment jig.stl](<STL/Blade cutting and alignment jig.stl>)

### License clarification regarding non-commercial use:
The non-commercial aspect of this license is for cases where Crossbow is the product, not the use of Crossbow to create products.<br/>
I.e. If you wish to sell Crossbow as a product, you would need to seek a commercial license before doing so. </br>
It is NOT intended to prevent the use of Crossbow in a printer that you use to provide commercial services. If you want to run Crossbow as a toolhead for your print farm printers, go right ahead.
